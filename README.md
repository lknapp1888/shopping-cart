# Shopping cart

Live preview of the site is available [here](https://lknapp1888.github.io/shopping-cart/)

## Project aims

- To create a single page shopping cart site with three different sub-sections (Homepage, Shop items page and a cart ) using React
- Utilise the Fetch API to populate the shopping cart

## Technologies used

React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

## Outcomes

- Improved understanding of `useEffect` hook (especially after later revisiting the project)
- More experience with fetching, state management and routing in React.
- Generalised increase in experience with React, covering multiple commonly used features and patterns

## Challenges

This was a largest React application I had made at this point from scratch, so managing the component structure and organising the state/props took some planning. This also gave me an appreciation of potential usages for `useContext` and reducers to manage state.

## Potential improvements

- More organised folder structure in `/src`
- Consider using a reducer to manage state
- Implement 'data', 'error', 'loading' state variables in the data fetching component (`Shop`) to improve user experience with conditional rendering.
